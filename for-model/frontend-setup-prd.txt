Please create the basic package structure, common files, and configuration files for the Frontend based on the following requirements.

Project Creation Order

Create frontend folder → Create frontend sub-package structure → Create React + Vite-based configuration files → set up node version 22 → Run React

Frontend Package Structure
When creating the frontend sub-package structure, it should be created with the following structure:
```
/frontend                  # Integrated frontend project (React + Vite + TypeScript)
  /public
    /favicon.ico          # Favicon
  /src
    /components
      /common             # Global common components
        /Layout.tsx       # Common layout component
        /Loading.tsx      # Loading component
    /pages                # Page components (React Router based)
      /HomePage.tsx       # Main homepage (includes BC-specific navigation)
    /services             # API and business logic
      /api
        /client.ts        # Axios client basic configuration
        /interceptors.ts  # API interceptors
        /types.ts         # API-related types
    /types                # TypeScript type definitions
      /common.types.ts    # Common type definitions
      /api.types.ts       # API-related types
    /utils                # Utility functions
      /constants.ts       # Constant definitions (API endpoints, etc.)
    /theme                # Material-UI theme configuration
      /index.ts           # Integrated theme configuration
    /App.tsx              # Root App component
    /main.tsx             # Vite entry point
    /index.css            # Global styles
    /vite-env.d.ts        # Vite type definitions
  package.json            # NPM package configuration
  vite.config.ts          # Vite build tool configuration
  tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
  .gitignore              # Git ignore file
  ```

Important Notes
1. For basic file creation, a React-based project compatible with Node22 should be created at a level that does not cause execution errors.
2. When creating files based on the package structure, HomePage.tsx should be created with only the initial basic configuration.
